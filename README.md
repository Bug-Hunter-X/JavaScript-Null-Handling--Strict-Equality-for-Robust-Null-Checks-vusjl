# JavaScript Null Handling: Strict Equality for Robust Null Checks

This example highlights a common JavaScript error involving null or undefined values and demonstrates best practices for handling them.  Loose equality (==) can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing null or undefined, which strict equality (===) avoids.

## Problem

JavaScript's loose comparison (==) can lead to unexpected results when comparing values against null or undefined because of type coercion.  This can cause silent failures or unpredictable behavior.

## Solution

Always use strict equality (===) when checking for null or undefined.  This ensures that you are comparing the values directly without any type coercion, resulting in more predictable and reliable code.

## Example

The `bug.js` file contains an example of a function that might inadvertently fail due to loose equality, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.
